## Description

Implement a robust error handling system that provides meaningful error messages and proper error recovery for all library operations

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Custom error classes for different failure types with inheritance hierarchy
- [ ] Detailed error messages with context information and troubleshooting hints
- [ ] Error categorization including connection errors effectively
- [ ] Error categorization including command execution errors effectively
- [ ] Error categorization including parsing and validation errors effectively
- [ ] Error categorization including configuration and setup errors effectively
- [ ] Error recovery strategies for transient failures with exponential backoff
- [ ] Proper error propagation through async operations with stack trace preservation
- [ ] Error logging and debugging capabilities with configurable levels
- [ ] Error handling documentation and examples with common scenarios
- [ ] Error metrics and monitoring integration for production usage
- [ ] Graceful degradation strategies when Hyprland is unavailable
- [ ] Error serialization and deserialization for IPC communication
