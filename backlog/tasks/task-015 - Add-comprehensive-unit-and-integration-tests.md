## Description

Create thorough test coverage for all library components including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end scenarios

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Unit tests for all core classes and functions with 95%+ code coverage
- [ ] Integration tests for socket communication with comprehensive mocked Hyprland
- [ ] End-to-end tests with real Hyprland instance and automated setup
- [ ] Test utilities for mocking Hyprland responses with realistic data
- [ ] Performance tests for high-frequency operations with baseline comparisons
- [ ] Error scenario testing for all failure modes and edge cases
- [ ] Continuous integration test pipeline configuration with parallel execution
- [ ] Property-based testing for complex data transformations and edge cases
- [ ] Mutation testing to verify test quality and coverage effectiveness
- [ ] Performance regression tests with automated benchmarking
- [ ] Test environment isolation and cleanup with containerization
- [ ] Load testing for concurrent operations and stress scenarios
