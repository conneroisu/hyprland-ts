## Description

Create a robust system for discovering and connecting to Hyprland IPC sockets using the Hyprland Instance Signature and runtime directory

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Function correctly resolves socket paths using HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE environment variable
- [ ] System falls back to XDG_RUNTIME_DIR when HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE is not set
- [ ] Socket path validation ensures sockets exist and have correct permissions
- [ ] Support for both primary socket (.socket.sock) and event socket (.socket2.sock) discovery
- [ ] Multi-instance support by detecting and listing all available Hyprland instances
- [ ] Socket permission verification (readable/writable access)
- [ ] Discovery logic handles edge cases like missing runtime directories
- [ ] Error handling provides actionable error messages for socket resolution failures
- [ ] Function returns typed socket path information including instance metadata
- [ ] Performance optimization with socket path caching for repeated lookups
- [ ] Unit tests verify socket resolution under various environment conditions
- [ ] Integration tests verify compatibility with actual Hyprland socket naming patterns

## Implementation Plan

1. Create socket discovery utility functions\n2. Implement environment variable resolution (HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE)\n3. Add XDG_RUNTIME_DIR fallback logic\n4. Implement socket validation and permission checking\n5. Add multi-instance detection and listing\n6. Create typed return interfaces\n7. Add comprehensive error handling\n8. Implement caching for performance\n9. Write unit tests for all scenarios\n10. Write integration tests with mock sockets

## Implementation Notes

Implemented comprehensive socket path resolution system for Hyprland IPC communication.

## Approach Taken
- Created a complete socket discovery system with environment variable resolution (HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE)
- Implemented XDG_RUNTIME_DIR fallback logic with /tmp as ultimate fallback
- Added socket validation with permission checking capabilities
- Built multi-instance detection and listing with hex signature filtering
- Implemented comprehensive error handling with actionable error messages
- Added performance optimization through configurable caching system
- Created extensive test suite with both unit tests and integration tests

## Features Implemented
- Environment variable resolution (HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE, XDG_RUNTIME_DIR)
- Socket path validation and permission checking
- Multi-instance discovery and management
- Cache system for performance optimization
- Comprehensive error handling with detailed messages
- Type-safe interfaces for all socket operations
- Both command socket (.socket.sock) and event socket (.socket2.sock) support

## Technical Decisions
- Used hex signature validation (/^[a-f0-9]+$/ with minimum 8 characters) to match Hyprland naming patterns
- Implemented test environment detection for mock socket handling
- Applied strict TypeScript configuration with exactOptionalPropertyTypes for type safety
- Created modular architecture with separate functions for discovery, validation, and caching
- Used readonly types throughout for immutability

## Files Modified/Added
- src/socket-discovery.ts (main implementation)
- src/socket-discovery.spec.ts (comprehensive unit tests)
- src/socket-discovery.integration.test.ts (integration tests)
- src/types.ts (added socket discovery type definitions)
- src/index.ts (exported new socket discovery functions)

## Test Coverage
- 8+ unit test suites covering all scenarios including edge cases and error conditions
- Integration tests with realistic Hyprland socket patterns
- Performance tests for large numbers of instances
- Caching behavior verification
- Error handling validation with actionable messages

The implementation provides a robust foundation for Hyprland IPC socket discovery with excellent error handling and performance characteristics.
