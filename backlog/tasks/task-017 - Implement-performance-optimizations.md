## Description

Add performance optimizations for high-frequency operations, efficient event handling, and memory management

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Connection pooling for multiple simultaneous operations
- [ ] Event batching and debouncing for high-frequency events
- [ ] Memory-efficient data structures for large datasets
- [ ] Caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Lazy loading for optional features and dependencies
- [ ] Performance monitoring and metrics collection
- [ ] Benchmark tests comparing with direct hyprctl usage
