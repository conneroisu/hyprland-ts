## Description

Add performance optimizations for high-frequency operations, efficient event handling, and memory management

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Connection pooling for multiple simultaneous operations with resource management
- [ ] Event batching and debouncing for high-frequency events with configurable thresholds
- [ ] Memory-efficient data structures for large datasets with garbage collection optimization
- [ ] Caching strategies for frequently accessed data with intelligent invalidation
- [ ] Lazy loading for optional features and dependencies with dynamic imports
- [ ] Performance monitoring and metrics collection with real-time dashboards
- [ ] Benchmark tests comparing with direct hyprctl usage and baseline measurements
- [ ] Performance budgets and thresholds with automated violation detection
- [ ] Profiling integration for development and production environments
- [ ] Performance regression prevention with automated testing
- [ ] Memory leak detection and prevention with monitoring tools
