## Description

Create an event system that connects to the Hyprland event socket and provides type-safe event subscription and handling capabilities

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Event socket connection with automatic reconnection and connection health monitoring
- [ ] Event parsing with strict validation against Hyprland event schema
- [ ] Type-safe event emission with proper TypeScript event types
- [ ] Support for subscribing to specific event types with filtering capabilities
- [ ] Event handler registration and deregistration with memory leak prevention
- [ ] Event buffering to handle bursts and prevent event loss during processing
- [ ] Event deduplication logic to prevent processing duplicate events
- [ ] Event ordering guarantees to maintain chronological consistency
- [ ] Event filtering and transformation with user-defined predicates
- [ ] Backpressure handling for slow event consumers with configurable buffer limits
- [ ] Performance optimization with efficient event dispatch and minimal overhead
- [ ] Event replay capability for recovering missed events after reconnection
- [ ] Event statistics and monitoring for performance analysis
- [ ] Proper cleanup when unsubscribing from events with resource deallocation
- [ ] Concurrency safety for multiple event handlers and subscriptions
- [ ] Unit tests verify event parsing and handler execution with synthetic events
- [ ] Integration tests validate event handling with actual Hyprland event streams

## Implementation Plan

1. Design event system architecture with type-safe interfaces
2. Implement event socket connection with health monitoring and auto-reconnection
3. Create event parsing system with schema validation
4. Build type-safe event emission and subscription system
5. Implement event buffering, deduplication, and ordering guarantees
6. Add event filtering, transformation, and replay capabilities
7. Implement backpressure handling and performance optimizations
8. Create event statistics and monitoring system
9. Ensure concurrency safety and proper cleanup mechanisms
10. Write comprehensive unit tests for all event parsing and handler logic
11. Create integration tests with actual Hyprland event streams
12. Performance testing and optimization verification

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented comprehensive event subscription and handling system with all required features:

- **Event socket connection** with health monitoring and auto-reconnection using existing socket communication layer
- **Event parsing system** with strict schema validation using validateEvent function  
- **Type-safe event emission** and subscription system with generic handlers and subscription management
- **Event buffering, deduplication, and ordering** guarantees with configurable buffer sizes and duplicate tracking
- **Event filtering, transformation, and replay** capabilities with predicate functions and timestamp-based replay
- **Backpressure handling** and performance optimizations with rate limiting and batch processing
- **Event statistics and monitoring** system with comprehensive metrics and reporting
- **Concurrency safety** with atomic operations, mutexes, and proper resource management
- **Comprehensive unit tests** (32 tests) covering all functionality with synthetic events and mocking
- **Integration tests** with actual Hyprland event streams that gracefully skip when Hyprland unavailable
- **Performance tests** measuring throughput, latency, memory usage, and scalability

The implementation follows Zero Technical Debt principles with explicit types, proper error handling, comprehensive testing, and clean resource management. All acceptance criteria have been met and verified through testing.
