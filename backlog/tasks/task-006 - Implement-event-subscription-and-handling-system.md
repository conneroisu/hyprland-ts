## Description

Create an event system that connects to the Hyprland event socket and provides type-safe event subscription and handling capabilities

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Event socket connection with automatic reconnection and connection health monitoring
- [ ] Event parsing with strict validation against Hyprland event schema
- [ ] Type-safe event emission with proper TypeScript event types
- [ ] Support for subscribing to specific event types with filtering capabilities
- [ ] Event handler registration and deregistration with memory leak prevention
- [ ] Event buffering to handle bursts and prevent event loss during processing
- [ ] Event deduplication logic to prevent processing duplicate events
- [ ] Event ordering guarantees to maintain chronological consistency
- [ ] Event filtering and transformation with user-defined predicates
- [ ] Backpressure handling for slow event consumers with configurable buffer limits
- [ ] Performance optimization with efficient event dispatch and minimal overhead
- [ ] Event replay capability for recovering missed events after reconnection
- [ ] Event statistics and monitoring for performance analysis
- [ ] Proper cleanup when unsubscribing from events with resource deallocation
- [ ] Concurrency safety for multiple event handlers and subscriptions
- [ ] Unit tests verify event parsing and handler execution with synthetic events
- [ ] Integration tests validate event handling with actual Hyprland event streams
