## Description

Implement a system for executing HyprCtl commands through the primary IPC socket with proper request formatting and response parsing

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Command execution function accepts typed command parameters with validation
- [ ] Requests properly formatted according to Hyprland IPC protocol specification
- [ ] Response parsing handles both JSON and text responses with type safety
- [ ] Command validation ensures only supported Hyprland commands are executed
- [ ] Batch command execution with transaction-like semantics for multiple operations
- [ ] Result caching with configurable TTL for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Version compatibility detection and command adaptation for different Hyprland versions
- [ ] Error handling distinguishes between command errors and communication failures
- [ ] Timeout handling for unresponsive commands with configurable duration
- [ ] Type-safe command builder with autocompletion for common operations
- [ ] Command history tracking for debugging and audit purposes
- [ ] Rate limiting to prevent overwhelming Hyprland with excessive requests
- [ ] Async/await interface with proper Promise handling and cancellation support
- [ ] Performance monitoring with execution time tracking and bottleneck identification
- [ ] Unit tests verify command formatting and response parsing with mock data
- [ ] Integration tests execute actual commands against Hyprland test instances
