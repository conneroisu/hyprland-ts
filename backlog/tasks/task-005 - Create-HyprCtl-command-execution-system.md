## Description

Implement a system for executing HyprCtl commands through the primary IPC socket with proper request formatting and response parsing

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Command execution function accepts typed command parameters with validation
- [ ] Requests properly formatted according to Hyprland IPC protocol specification
- [ ] Response parsing handles both JSON and text responses with type safety
- [ ] Command validation ensures only supported Hyprland commands are executed
- [ ] Batch command execution with transaction-like semantics for multiple operations
- [ ] Result caching with configurable TTL for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Version compatibility detection and command adaptation for different Hyprland versions
- [ ] Error handling distinguishes between command errors and communication failures
- [ ] Timeout handling for unresponsive commands with configurable duration
- [ ] Type-safe command builder with autocompletion for common operations
- [ ] Command history tracking for debugging and audit purposes
- [ ] Rate limiting to prevent overwhelming Hyprland with excessive requests
- [ ] Async/await interface with proper Promise handling and cancellation support
- [ ] Performance monitoring with execution time tracking and bottleneck identification
- [ ] Unit tests verify command formatting and response parsing with mock data
- [ ] Integration tests execute actual commands against Hyprland test instances

## Implementation Plan

1. Analyze existing socket communication layer from task-004 to understand the interface
2. Define HyprCtl command types and interfaces for type-safe command building
3. Implement core command execution function with request formatting
4. Add response parsing for both JSON and text responses with proper error handling
5. Implement command validation against supported Hyprland commands
6. Add timeout handling and cancellation support for command execution
7. Implement batch command execution with transaction semantics
8. Add result caching system with configurable TTL
9. Implement version compatibility detection and command adaptation
10. Add rate limiting to prevent overwhelming Hyprland
11. Implement command history tracking for debugging
12. Add performance monitoring with execution time tracking
13. Create comprehensive unit tests with mock data
14. Implement integration tests against real Hyprland instances
15. Add type-safe command builder with autocompletion support
