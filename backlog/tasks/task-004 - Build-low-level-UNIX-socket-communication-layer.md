## Description

Implement the foundational UNIX socket communication layer for sending commands and receiving responses from Hyprland IPC sockets

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Socket connection establishment with proper error handling and resource management
- [ ] Message framing protocol implementation for reliable data transmission
- [ ] Partial message handling with buffering for incomplete socket reads
- [ ] Connection pooling support for multiple concurrent socket connections
- [ ] Backpressure management to prevent memory issues with slow consumers
- [ ] Message sending with confirmation and retry logic for failed transmissions
- [ ] Message receiving with configurable timeout and error recovery
- [ ] Connection state management with detailed status reporting (connecting/connected/disconnected/error)
- [ ] Proper resource cleanup on connection close or error conditions
- [ ] Support for both request-response and streaming communication patterns
- [ ] Binary and text message support with automatic encoding detection
- [ ] Socket reconnection logic with exponential backoff for temporary failures
- [ ] Performance optimization with connection reuse and efficient buffer management
- [ ] Concurrency safety for multiple threads accessing socket connections
- [ ] Unit tests cover complete connection lifecycle and error scenarios
- [ ] Integration tests verify compatibility with actual Hyprland socket behavior

## Implementation Plan

1. Design socket communication layer architecture with proper abstractions
2. Implement core UNIX socket connection management with error handling
3. Build message framing protocol for reliable data transmission
4. Add connection pooling system for concurrent socket connections
5. Implement backpressure management and timeout handling
6. Create connection state management with detailed status reporting
7. Add socket reconnection logic with exponential backoff
8. Implement performance optimizations with connection reuse
9. Ensure concurrency safety for multi-threaded access
10. Write comprehensive unit tests for all connection scenarios
11. Create integration tests with actual Hyprland socket behavior
