## Description

Implement the foundational UNIX socket communication layer for sending commands and receiving responses from Hyprland IPC sockets

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Socket connection establishment with proper error handling and resource management
- [ ] Message framing protocol implementation for reliable data transmission
- [ ] Partial message handling with buffering for incomplete socket reads
- [ ] Connection pooling support for multiple concurrent socket connections
- [ ] Backpressure management to prevent memory issues with slow consumers
- [ ] Message sending with confirmation and retry logic for failed transmissions
- [ ] Message receiving with configurable timeout and error recovery
- [ ] Connection state management with detailed status reporting (connecting/connected/disconnected/error)
- [ ] Proper resource cleanup on connection close or error conditions
- [ ] Support for both request-response and streaming communication patterns
- [ ] Binary and text message support with automatic encoding detection
- [ ] Socket reconnection logic with exponential backoff for temporary failures
- [ ] Performance optimization with connection reuse and efficient buffer management
- [ ] Concurrency safety for multiple threads accessing socket connections
- [ ] Unit tests cover complete connection lifecycle and error scenarios
- [ ] Integration tests verify compatibility with actual Hyprland socket behavior
