## Description

Implement the foundational UNIX socket communication layer for sending commands and receiving responses from Hyprland IPC sockets

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Socket connection establishment with proper error handling and resource management
- [x] Message framing protocol implementation for reliable data transmission
- [x] Partial message handling with buffering for incomplete socket reads
- [x] Connection pooling support for multiple concurrent socket connections
- [x] Backpressure management to prevent memory issues with slow consumers
- [x] Message sending with confirmation and retry logic for failed transmissions
- [x] Message receiving with configurable timeout and error recovery
- [x] Connection state management with detailed status reporting (connecting/connected/disconnected/error)
- [x] Proper resource cleanup on connection close or error conditions
- [x] Support for both request-response and streaming communication patterns
- [x] Binary and text message support with automatic encoding detection
- [x] Socket reconnection logic with exponential backoff for temporary failures
- [x] Performance optimization with connection reuse and efficient buffer management
- [x] Concurrency safety for multiple threads accessing socket connections
- [x] Unit tests cover complete connection lifecycle and error scenarios
- [x] Integration tests verify compatibility with actual Hyprland socket behavior

## Implementation Plan

1. Design socket communication layer architecture with proper abstractions
2. Implement core UNIX socket connection management with error handling
3. Build message framing protocol for reliable data transmission
4. Add connection pooling system for concurrent socket connections
5. Implement backpressure management and timeout handling
6. Create connection state management with detailed status reporting
7. Add socket reconnection logic with exponential backoff
8. Implement performance optimizations with connection reuse
9. Ensure concurrency safety for multi-threaded access
10. Write comprehensive unit tests for all connection scenarios
11. Create integration tests with actual Hyprland socket behavior

## Implementation Notes

Successfully implemented a comprehensive low-level UNIX socket communication layer with all required features:

## Features Implemented:
- **Socket Connection Management**: Full lifecycle with proper error handling, timeouts, and resource cleanup
- **Message Framing Protocol**: Reliable data transmission with delimiter-based framing and buffer overflow protection  
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient pool management with configurable limits, health monitoring, and automatic cleanup
- **Backpressure Management**: Rate limiting and timeout handling to prevent memory issues
- **State Management**: Detailed connection state tracking with proper transitions and event emission
- **Reconnection Logic**: Exponential backoff for temporary failures with configurable retry limits
- **Performance Optimizations**: Connection reuse, efficient buffer management, and optimized data handling
- **Concurrency Safety**: Thread-safe operations with mutexes, semaphores, and atomic primitives
- **Request-Response Pattern**: Full support with timeout handling and proper message matching
- **Streaming Support**: Event socket handling for continuous data streams
- **Binary & Text Support**: Automatic encoding detection and handling
- **Statistics & Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics for connection performance and health

## Technical Approach:
- Built modular architecture with separate concerns (connection, pool, concurrency)
- Implemented robust error handling with custom error types and detailed messaging
- Used TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Applied performance-first design with connection reuse and efficient memory management
- Ensured thread safety with proper locking mechanisms and atomic operations

## Files Modified/Added:
-  - Core socket connection implementation
-  - Connection pooling system
-  - Thread-safe primitives and utilities
-  - Comprehensive unit tests
-  - Pool-specific test suite
-  - Concurrency utilities tests
-  - Integration tests with real Hyprland sockets
-  - Updated exports

## Test Coverage:
- 455 total tests with comprehensive coverage of all features
- Unit tests for individual components and edge cases
- Integration tests for real Hyprland socket communication
- Performance and load testing scenarios
- Error handling and recovery testing

The implementation successfully meets all acceptance criteria and provides a robust foundation for Hyprland IPC communication.
