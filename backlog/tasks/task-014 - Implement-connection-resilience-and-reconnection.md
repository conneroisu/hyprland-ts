## Description

Add robust connection management with automatic reconnection, retry logic, and graceful degradation for improved reliability

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Automatic reconnection on connection loss with exponential backoff strategy
- [ ] Connection health monitoring and heartbeat with configurable intervals
- [ ] Graceful handling of temporary socket unavailability with degraded functionality
- [ ] Command queuing during reconnection attempts with overflow protection
- [ ] Event subscription restoration after reconnection with state synchronization
- [ ] Connection state events for client notification and monitoring
- [ ] Configurable retry policies and connection timeouts with limits
- [ ] Connection state persistence across application restarts
- [ ] Connection health scoring and quality metrics
- [ ] Failover mechanisms for multiple Hyprland instances
- [ ] Performance monitoring for connection operations with alerting
