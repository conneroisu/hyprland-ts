## Description

Add robust connection management with automatic reconnection, retry logic, and graceful degradation for improved reliability

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Automatic reconnection on connection loss with exponential backoff
- [ ] Connection health monitoring and heartbeat
- [ ] Graceful handling of temporary socket unavailability
- [ ] Command queuing during reconnection attempts
- [ ] Event subscription restoration after reconnection
- [ ] Connection state events for client notification
- [ ] Configurable retry policies and connection timeouts
