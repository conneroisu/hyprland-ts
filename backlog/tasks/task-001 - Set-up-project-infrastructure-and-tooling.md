## Description

Establish the foundational project structure, build system, and development tooling for the Hyprland TypeScript library

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Package.json with proper dependencies and scripts configured
- [ ] TypeScript configuration with strict type checking enabled
- [ ] Super Strict Biome configured for code quality
- [ ] Strict Oxlint configured for additional linting
- [ ] Flat Prettier configured for code formatting
- [ ] Vitest configured for unit testing (with example test files)
- [ ] Build system producing both CommonJS and ESM outputs
- [ ] Node.js version compatibility (18+ LTS) specified and tested
- [ ] Security audit tools configured and passing
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline basic structure defined
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility verified on Linux systems
- [ ] Development environment can run linting and tests successfully
- [ ] Confirm Zero Linting Issues

## Implementation Plan

1. Review existing project structure and package.json\n2. Configure TypeScript with strict settings\n3. Set up Biome for super strict code quality\n4. Configure Oxlint for additional linting\n5. Set up Prettier for code formatting\n6. Configure Vitest for testing with example tests\n7. Set up build system for dual CommonJS/ESM output\n8. Verify Node.js compatibility and cross-platform support\n9. Run all tools to ensure zero linting issues\n10. Document implementation approach in task notes
