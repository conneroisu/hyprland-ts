## Description

Establish a robust testing foundation for the hyprland-ts library that includes test infrastructure setup, comprehensive unit tests for all type definitions and validation utilities, integration tests for API interactions with mocked and real Hyprland instances, and property-based testing for enhanced robustness and edge case coverage

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test infrastructure is configured with proper tooling and CI integration
- [ ] Unit tests achieve 95%+ code coverage for all type definitions and validation functions
- [ ] Integration tests validate API interactions with both mocked and real Hyprland instances
- [ ] Property-based testing framework is implemented for complex data validation scenarios
- [ ] Test utilities and mocks provide realistic Hyprland response data
- [ ] Performance and load testing infrastructure is established with baseline measurements
- [ ] Error scenario testing covers all failure modes and edge cases
- [ ] Test environment isolation and cleanup procedures are implemented
